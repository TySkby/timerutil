"""
This module provides simple decorator/context manager that prevents an operations from finishing
before a given number of seconds has elapsed.

Useful if you're fairly confident that your function should finish in a certain amount of time,
but you want to make the return time constant (eg. to prevent constant-time attacks).

For example, if we know that our password reset function always takes about 1 second to execute
if the given email address is valid but if the email address is invalid, it usually finishes much faster,
We can ensure that it always takes 2 seconds to execute whenever it's called.

This is less useful if your function's normal execution time is subject to a lot of jitter.
